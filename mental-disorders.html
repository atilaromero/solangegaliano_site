                        <h3>PANIC DISORDER</h3>
                        <p>Has the presence of recurrent, unexpected panic attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent worry about having another panic attack. The characteristic symptoms of a panic attack are: palpitations or tachycardia, sweating, trembling or shaking, feeling short of breath or suffocation, choking sensations, chest pain or discomfort, nausea or abdominal distress, feeling dizzy, unsteadiness, lightheadedness or fainting, fear of losing control or going crazy, fear of dying, paresthesias, and chills or heat waves.</p>

                        <h3>SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER (SOCIAL PHOBIA)</h3>
                        <p>Is characterized by clinically significant anxiety provoked by exposure to certain types of social or performance situations in which the individual is exposed to strangers or to possible scrutiny by others, often leading to avoidance behaviour.</p>

                        <h3>OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER</h3>
                        <p>Is characterized by obsessions (which cause marked anxiety or distress) and/or compulsions (which serve to neutralize anxiety). Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, or significantly interfere with the individual's usual routine, occupational functioning, activities, or social relationships.</p>

The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning or other important areas of the individual's life.</p>

                        <p>Includes restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. There is an intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight, and a disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.</p>

                        <p>Includes recurrent episodes of binge eating and recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.</p>

Recurrent episodes of eating, in a discrete period of time (within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time under similar circumstances. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episodes. The binge-eating episodes are associated with three or more of the following: eating much more rapidly than normal, eating until feeling uncomfortably full, eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry, feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or guilty after overeating. The episodes occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.</p>
