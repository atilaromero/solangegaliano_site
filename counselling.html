            <h1>Counselling</h1>
            <p>Counselling therapy makes use of psychological methods, techniques, and interventions whose main objectives are:</p>
            <p>- restore the patient's quality of life;</p>
            <p>- analyse the reasons for consultation, which range from common day-to-day difficulties to even major psychopathologies;</p>
            <p>- develop the patterns of mental functioning of the individual and their psychic systems: organic health, mental health, family, social, sexual, intellectual, financial, professional, leisure, and spiritual.</p>
