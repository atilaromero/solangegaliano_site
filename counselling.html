            <h1>Counselling</h1>
            <p>Counselling therapy makes use of psychological methods, techniques, and interventions whose main objectives are:</p>
            <p>- restore the patient's quality of life;</p>
            <p>- analyse the reasons for consultation, which range from common day-to-day difficulties to even major psychopathologies;</p>
            <p>- develop the patterns of mental functioning of the individual and their psychic systems: organic health, mental health, family, social, sexual, intellectual, financial, professional, leisure, and spiritual.</p>

                    <h3>FREQUENCY</h3>
                    <p>Most treatments require weekly sessions to be effective. Patients being discharged have sessions once every two weeks. If necessary, the patient can request extra appointments or reschedule existing ones in advance.</p>
